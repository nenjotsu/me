# MQL5 vs C++: Similarities and Differences Explained  

If you’ve ever peeked under the hood of trading bots in MetaTrader 5 (MT5), you’ve probably encountered **MQL5**—MetaQuotes Language 5. And if you’ve studied computer science or software engineering, chances are you’ve also worked with **C++**, the titan of high-performance programming.  

At first glance, these two languages look surprisingly similar. Both share familiar syntax, data types, and structures. But don’t let appearances fool you: under the surface, they live in very different worlds.  

In this article, we’re going to do a deep dive into **MQL5 vs C++**, uncovering where they align, where they diverge, and what it means for developers. Think of this like exploring parallel universes—one optimized for financial trading, the other for everything from operating systems to video games.  

By the end, you’ll not only understand the key differences but also see why MQL5 borrows so much from C++ and where it chooses to go its own way.

## What Is MQL5?  

MQL5 (MetaQuotes Language 5) is a specialized programming language built by MetaQuotes Software for **algorithmic trading** on MetaTrader 5.  

Its focus?  
- Writing **Expert Advisors (EAs)** (a fancy term for trading bots).  
- Creating **custom indicators**.  
- Designing **scripts** to automate repetitive tasks.  
- Building **libraries** for reusable trading functions.  

It comes with built-in access to price data, trading functions, and events like `OnTick()` (triggered every market tick).  

MQL5 is not general-purpose like C++—it lives exclusively in the trading world.

## What Is C++?  

C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages on the planet. It’s:  
- **General-purpose**: used in operating systems, compilers, databases, games, browsers, and more.  
- **High-performance**: close to hardware, often used where speed matters.  
- **Feature-rich**: offering object-oriented programming (OOP), templates, and advanced memory management.  

Think of C++ as a Swiss Army knife for computer science, while MQL5 is more like a specialized scalpel for trading.

## Shared DNA: Why MQL5 Looks Like C++  

If you’ve coded in C++, opening up MQL5 feels oddly familiar. And that’s by design.  

### Familiar Syntax  
Variables, functions, loops, conditionals—all look almost identical.  

**MQL5 Example (Expert Advisor skeleton):**  
```c++
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Expert initialization function                                   |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
int OnInit()
  {
   Print("Expert initialized");
   return(INIT_SUCCEEDED);
  }
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Expert deinitialization function                                 |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void OnDeinit(const int reason)
  {
   Print("Expert deinitialized");
  }
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
//| Expert tick function                                             |
//+------------------------------------------------------------------+
void OnTick()
  {
   Print("New tick: ", Symbol(), " price: ", SymbolInfoDouble(Symbol(), SYMBOL_BID));
  }
```

C++ Example (Hello World with similar structure):

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Program initialized" << endl;

    // Equivalent to OnTick loop
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "Tick " << i << endl;
    }

    cout << "Program deinitialized" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Notice the similarities in structure: initialization, looping (ticks), and cleanup.

Data Types and Structures

Both MQL5 and C++ support common data types like int, double, bool, string, and arrays. Both allow custom structures with struct.

MQL5 Struct Example:
```c++
struct TradeInfo {
   string symbol;
   double volume;
   double price;
};
```

C++ Struct Example:
```c++
struct TradeInfo {
    std::string symbol;
    double volume;
    double price;
};
```

Almost identical!

## Key Differences Between MQL5 and C++

This is where the plot thickens. Despite the surface-level similarities, MQL5 and C++ are optimized for very different goals.

1. Purpose and Domain

**MQL5** : Built solely for trading in MT5. You can’t build an operating system or video game in MQL5—it only runs inside MetaTrader.

**C++** : General-purpose. You can build a trading platform itself in C++.

Think of MQL5 as a scripting layer on top of MT5’s trading engine, whereas C++ is the raw engine builder.

2. Standard Libraries vs Built-in Trading Functions

C++ comes with the STL (Standard Template Library) and third-party libraries for just about anything.

MQL5, instead, has trading libraries baked in:
```c++
OrderSend() → Place an order.

PositionGetDouble() → Get details about a position.

iMA() → Calculate a Moving Average.

MQL5 Example: Place a Buy Order

void OnTick()
  {
   if(SymbolInfoDouble(_Symbol, SYMBOL_BID) < 1800.0)
     {
      MqlTradeRequest request;
      MqlTradeResult result;
      ZeroMemory(request);
      request.action   = TRADE_ACTION_DEAL;
      request.symbol   = _Symbol;
      request.volume   = 0.1;
      request.type     = ORDER_TYPE_BUY;
      request.price    = SymbolInfoDouble(_Symbol, SYMBOL_ASK);
      OrderSend(request, result);
     }
  }
```

You won’t find anything like `OrderSend()` in C++—that’s unique to MQL5’s trading domain.

3. Event-Driven vs Procedural Flow

MQL5: Runs on events like OnTick(), OnTimer(), OnTrade(). It reacts to trading events.

C++: Runs procedurally—you design the event loop yourself or use frameworks.

In MQL5, the runtime is provided by MT5. In C++, you are the runtime architect.

4. Memory Management

C++: Manual memory management with new, delete, pointers, and references.

MQL5: Handles memory automatically (closer to high-level scripting). No manual pointer arithmetic.

This makes MQL5 safer for traders, but less flexible for system-level performance hacks.

5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Both languages support OOP, but with different flavors.

MQL5 Example (Simple Class):
```c++
class Strategy {
public:
   void Buy(string symbol, double volume) {
      Print("Buying ", symbol, " with volume ", volume);
   }
};
```

C++ Example (Simple Class):
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Strategy {
public:
    void Buy(string symbol, double volume) {
        cout << "Buying " << symbol << " with volume " << volume << endl;
    }
};
```

C++ has advanced OOP features like templates and multiple inheritance, while MQL5 keeps things simpler.

6. Execution Environment

MQL5: Runs inside MT5. It can’t run standalone.

C++: Compiles to native machine code, runs anywhere with the right compiler.

This means MQL5 scripts are sandboxed and can only interact with MT5 APIs.

7. Performance

C++ will always outperform MQL5 in raw computational tasks. But MQL5 is “fast enough” for trading strategies, since it’s tightly integrated with MT5’s engine.

If you need high-frequency trading (HFT) at the microsecond level, you’d likely pair C++ with FIX APIs or exchange-native code, not MQL5.

When to Use MQL5 vs C++

Use MQL5 if:

You’re building strategies, indicators, or scripts inside MT5.

You need access to chart data, orders, and trading events.

You want faster prototyping without worrying about memory management.

Use C++ if:

You’re building infrastructure like a trading platform, low-latency execution engine, or risk management system.

You need maximum performance.

You want to integrate with multiple APIs beyond MT5.

Many professional traders actually use both: C++ for execution engines and MQL5 for strategy prototyping.

Bridging MQL5 and C++

Here’s where things get exciting. You can integrate MQL5 with external DLLs written in C++ for extended functionality.

MQL5 Calling a C++ DLL Example:
```c++
#import "mydll.dll"
   int CustomFunction(int x, int y);
#import

void OnStart() {
   int result = CustomFunction(5, 10);
   Print("Result from DLL: ", result);
}
```

C++ Side (DLL Code):
```c++
extern "C" __declspec(dllexport) int CustomFunction(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}
```

This way, you get the best of both worlds: MQL5’s trading environment with C++’s raw power.

The Big Picture

So, MQL5 and C++ are like cousins:

Shared syntax and style (making MQL5 approachable to C++ developers).

Different goals (finance vs general computing).

Different ecosystems (MT5 runtime vs OS-level execution).

You could say MQL5 is a specialized derivative of C++, like a dialect tailored for traders.

## Conclusion

If you’ve been coding in MQL5 and thought, “This feels like C++ in a suit and tie,” you’re not wrong. MQL5 borrows heavily from C++’s design, but it trims away low-level complexity to focus on one thing: trading automation in MT5.

Meanwhile, C++ remains the heavyweight champion of general-purpose programming—capable of building anything from trading platforms to spacecraft control systems.

The real magic happens when you see them as complementary tools. MQL5 makes strategy development fast and easy, while C++ gives you full control when performance and scale matter most.

So the next time you fire up MetaEditor and write OnTick(), remember—you’re working in a specialized universe built on C++’s DNA.

## Call to Action

Curious about diving deeper? Try this experiment:

Write a simple trading strategy in MQL5.

Then, rebuild the core logic in C++.

Compare the syntax, performance, and flexibility.

Not only will this sharpen your trading bot skills, but you’ll also gain a deeper appreciation of why these two languages, though siblings in style, live such different lives.
