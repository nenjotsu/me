# What Should You Actually Calculate in Market Analysis?

## The Math That Matters

If you're serious about market analysis, there are a few core things you should be calculating. These aren't just numbers — they're decision-making tools.

- **Risk per trade**  
This is your first line of defense. Whether you use fixed risk or percentage-based sizing, calculating your risk based on account balance and stop loss is non-negotiable.

- **Reward-to-risk ratio (RRR)**  
You're not just trading setups — you're trading probabilities. Understanding your average RRR helps you measure the quality of your trades, not just the quantity.

- **Win rate vs. payoff ratio**  
A 40% win rate can still be profitable with a high RRR. A 70% win rate can lose money if your losses are too big. The balance between these two tells the real story.

- **Average drawdown and max drawdown**  
Emotions follow drawdowns. If you don’t know how deep your system tends to dip, you won’t know when to stop — or when to trust it.

- **Expectancy**  
This is your true edge:  
(Win rate × Avg win) – (Loss rate × Avg loss)  
It gives you a clear number for how much you stand to make (or lose) per trade over time.

## What You Think You Need to Calculate (But Don’t)

Here’s where overcalculation begins. These metrics sound smart but often distract more than they help.

- **Over-optimized indicator values**  
Whether your RSI is set to 12 or 13 won’t fix bad trade logic.

- **Complex volatility formulas**  
ATR is enough for most strategies. You probably don’t need GARCH models.

- **Exhaustive correlation matrices**  
Unless you’re building a hedge fund-level portfolio, they’re overkill.

- **Overly granular timeframes**  
Calculating micro-trends on the 3-second chart? That’s not precision — that’s noise.

## The Pitfalls of Overcalculating

Overanalysis leads to:

- **Paralysis**  
You hesitate because the numbers don’t "line up perfectly." They never will.

- **Overfitting**  
You optimize your system to perform well on past data… and it breaks live.

- **False confidence**  
More math can give the illusion of control. The market still does what it wants.

The market is dynamic. When you overcalculate, you’re chasing a static version of something that's constantly evolving.

## How to Use Math Properly in Trading

Math isn’t your enemy. But it needs boundaries.

- **Use math to measure behavior, not to predict certainty.**
- **Focus on high-impact metrics that reflect risk, consistency, and expectancy.**
- **Validate with logic, not just numbers — sometimes price action tells you more than a spreadsheet ever will.**
- **Keep your system explainable — if you can’t describe it without a calculator, it’s too complex.**

## Final Thoughts

Successful market analysis doesn’t come from using the most math — it comes from using the right math.

The real edge lies in simplicity, clarity, and execution. Know your numbers, but don’t let them run the show.
