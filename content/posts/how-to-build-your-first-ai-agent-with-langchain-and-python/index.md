# How to Build Your First AI Agent with LangChain and Python

## Getting Started with LangChain Framework

To begin building your first AI agent, you'll need to install the required packages. Start by creating a new Python environment and installing LangChain along with OpenAI integration:

```python
pip install langchain openai python-dotenv
```

Next, set up your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.tools import Tool
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

## Creating Your First AI Agent

Initialize your language model and create a simple tool for the agent to use:
```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=lambda query: f"Searching for: {query}",
        description="Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events"
    )
]

agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)
```

Test your agent with a simple query:
```python
response = agent.run("What is the weather today?")
print(response)
```

## Enhancing Agent Capabilities

Add memory to your agent for better context retention:
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)
```

Create a more sophisticated tool that can perform actual web searches:
```python
import requests

def web_search(query):
    # This is a simplified example - in practice, you'd use a proper search API
    return f"Results for: {query} (simulated search results)"

search_tool = Tool(
    name="Web Search",
    func=web_search,
    description="Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events or general knowledge"
)

agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[search_tool],
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)
```

## Final Thoughts

Building your first AI agent with LangChain and Python opens up endless possibilities for creating intelligent applications. This tutorial provided the foundational knowledge needed to construct basic agents that can understand queries, execute tasks, and maintain conversational context.

The key takeaway is that LangChain simplifies complex AI workflows by providing clean abstractions for language models, tools, and memory management. As you progress, you can expand your agent's capabilities by integrating more sophisticated tools, connecting to databases, or implementing custom memory systems.

Remember that the beauty of LangChain lies in its modular approach - you can easily swap out language models, add new tools, or modify agent behavior without rewriting entire systems. This flexibility makes it an excellent starting point for anyone looking to dive into AI agent development, whether for personal projects, business applications, or research purposes.
