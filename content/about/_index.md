Hey, I’m Nenjo — a software engineer with over a decade of experience building scalable systems, backend architectures, and automation tools that don’t crash… most of the time.

I created nenjo.tech to document the stuff I wish someone had written when I started: real-world insights about programming languages (like Go, Python, and even the occasional battle with C++), clean software architecture, design patterns that actually matter, and my ongoing journey building automated trading bots for Forex, gold, and crypto markets.

If you’re a fellow dev, trader, or just someone who enjoys solving ridiculously complex problems for fun — welcome. This blog is for you.

Expect code, crashes, solutions, and maybe some sarcasm — all in the name of better engineering and smarter trading.
